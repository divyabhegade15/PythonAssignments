Task 1: python program that takes defines a function named factorial and takes a number as argument and displays the factorial of that number.

Task 2: Python program that imports math module and perform calculations to find squareroot,logarithm and sine of a number.

-->Assignment 4:
Task 1: Python program that: Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
      Prints its content line by line. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.
